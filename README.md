The AdShield is a javascript to the protected for click spam or bomb protection from bot or false clicked make traffic adsense up


How it works: 

The adShield work by assumption. AdShield assume that the link below the cursor causing a web page move to another page when it happen. If the link was arround adShield area upon page move, it will then recognized as a click. When a click reach a certain number, adShield will prevent user to view the protected area (in this case ads).

With the same assumption, when a user roughly clicking adShield area in intention for spamming clicks, it will then immediately hide the area after certain clicks as defined on configuration.
