AdShield v 0.1 (Minified Version)

AdShield is a click spam/bomb protection.

How it works:
The adsShield work by assumption.
AdsShield assume that the link below the cursor causing a web page move to another page when it happen.
If the link was arround adsShield area upon page move, it will then recognized as a click.
When a click reach a certain number, adsShield will prevent user to view the protected area (in this case ads).

With the same assumption, when a user roughly clicking AdShield area in intention for spamming clicks,
it will then immediately hide the area after certain clicks as defined on configuration.
